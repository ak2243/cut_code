## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to create an environment where beginners can learn how to code in an emulatory environment without getting bogged down by some of the more technical details.

However, as time went on, another purpose emerged: beginners could use cut code to contribute snippets of code to actual projects.

When cut code runs block code, it converts it to actual code that can then be exported to a file and used in bigger projects.

## Basic Usage

### Language Picking
When you launch cut code, you will see a menu to pick the language in which you would like to run the program:

*Note to advanced users: you can override the default language commands by inputting your own executable from the filesystem. Cut code will not check that you have entered a fully functional file.*

Once you have selected your language, you can proceed with using the program.

### Coding with Cut Code
Cut code offers a palette of the basic blocks you need to write functional block code.

Here is an example of a program that takes a number (180 in this case), checks if it is even, and outputs 'true' if the number is even ('false' if it's odd):

Once the program is run, you should see something like this:
